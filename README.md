# Online-Code-Courses-Platform
This web application is the result of my undergraduate thesis project. It serves as an online platform for programming courses, providing a user-friendly code editor for assignments. The system includes user roles such as administrators, teachers (responsible and non-responsible), students, and unregistered users.
